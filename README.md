## try it

this is app is not yet released on the app store, if you want to try it, download the files and import into xcode and run it locally. it works on mac and ipad, maybe ios too. you can also email me to be a beta-tester, at tomomyrman@proton.me.

## how it's made

**tech used:** swift, swiftui

this is my first ipad game i've made (but not my first iphone app), and i knew i wanted to base it off a real need. many people get overstimulated by sound, sights and people. this game is intended to provide a moment of relief and to simply lose yourself.

## lessons learned

i learned how to build an app for ipads, which turned out to be really easy with swift. previously, i've only used react native. swift was challenging sometimes, it complains a lot about type safety and uses a different programming structure than i'm used to, but it was also rewarding to use my brain in a different way. while coding, i started to optimise my code and understand how views worked and how to separate my logic more efficiently.
